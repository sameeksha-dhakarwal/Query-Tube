cliZ-VzQxkE,I Let 3 AIs Compete to Build the Same App…,"Today, I'm putting three of the most hyped AI coding platforms to the test: Blitzy, Devin, and Factory AI. Now, each of these tools take a slightly different approach to building software. I'm going to give all three of them the exact same real world task, something the developers actually do in companies all the time. We're going to see which platform performs the best, and how much effort it takes from my end, the programmer.

DevLaunch is my mentorship program where I personally help developers go beyond tutorials, build real-world projects, and actually land jobs. No fluff. Just real accountability, proven strategies, and hands-on guidance. Learn more here - https://training.devlaunch.us/tim?video=cliZ-VzQxkE

Python is definitely an interesting language that has many unique features. However, many of these features are never actually used out in the wild because people simply don't know they exist. So in this video, I'm going to go over some more modern and relatively new Python features that I rarely see used that I think are interesting and that you should definitely know about.
